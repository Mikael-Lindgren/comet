What is Comet?
--------------

Comet is a library that provides a modern (STL-like) C++ interface
around the complexities of Microsoft COM. It allows you to do both COM
client and COM server programming, without any dependency on either
ATL or MFC.  Instead, it builds upon the C++ Standard Library that is
included with every modern C++ compiler, regardless of platform.

### I have seen other versions of comet. What version is this?

Other versions of Comet are most likely version 1 gamma 32 plus or
minus a few bugfixes.  This is Comet version 2 because it breaks
backward compatibility with those versions so that we can develop it
more freely.

Comet was designed and implemented by [Sofus Mortensen] with
contributions, ideas and bug fixes from [Paul Hollingsworth], Michael
Geddes, [Mikael Lindgren], [Kyle Alons] and [Vladimir Voinkov].  This
version of comet is maintained by [Alexander Lamaison].

How do I use comet?
-------------------

Just add `comet/include` to your compiler's include path and you are
ready to go.

### CMake

If you're using [CMake] for your project, Comet can set this up for
you.  Remember you don't have to compile Comet.  The CMake files just
make it easier to use in an existing CMake project.

Configure Comet.  This will export it to the [user package registry]

    $ cmake -H . -B _builds -DBUILD_TESTING=NO

In your project, locate the exported project and link it with any
targets that need it.

    find_package(Comet REQUIRED CONFIG)
    target_link_libraries(my_project_target PRIVATE comet)

Because Comet is header-only, this doesn't link in the traditional
sense.  It just makes the target aware of Comet's [usage requirements]
such as the include path.  Referencing Comet this way means you don't
have to change your build configuration if those requirements change
in the future.

[usage requirements]: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#target-usage-requirements
[CMake]: http://www.cmake.org

What about a reference?  Or tutorials?
--------------------------------------

The library is documented inline and you can use [Doxygen] to generate
documentation for it if you want.  Also, read the following articles.
They are based on Comet v1 but, as yet, there isn't much difference.

* [Introducing Comet](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5748/Introducing-Comet)
* [Introduction to Comet](http://www.lambdasoft.dk/comet/introduction/index.htm)

And last but not least, the [Comet version 1 documentation](http://www.lambdasoft.dk/comet/documentation.htm).

Are there any dependencies?
---------------------------

No, not really.  We use [Boost], but only for the test suite so you
don't even need that.
